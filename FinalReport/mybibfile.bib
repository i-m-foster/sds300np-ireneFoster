abstract = {Machine learning research within healthcare frequently lacks the public data needed to be fully reproducible and comparable. Datasets are often restricted due to privacy concerns and legal requirements that come with patient-related data. Consequentially, many algorithms and models get published on the same topic without a standard benchmark to measure against. Therefore, this paper presents HYPERAKTIV, a public dataset containing health, activity, and heart rate data from patients diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, better known as ADHD. The dataset consists of data collected from 51 patients with ADHD and 52 clinical controls. In addition to the activity and heart rate data, we also include a series of patient attributes such as their age, sex, and information about their mental state, as well as output data from a computerized neuropsychological test. Together with the presented dataset, we also provide baseline experiments using traditional machine learning algorithms to predict ADHD based on the included activity data. We hope that this dataset can be used as a starting point for computer scientists who want to contribute to the field of mental health, and as a common benchmark for future work in ADHD analysis.},

It must be diagnosed efficiently and consistently to receive adequate treatment, otherwise, it can have a detrimental impact on the patient’s professional performance, mental health, and relationships. In this work, motor activity data of adults suffering from ADHD and clinical controls has been preprocessed to obtain 788 activity-related statistical features. Afterwards, principal component analysis has been carried out to obtain significant features for accurate classification. These features are then fed into six different machine learning algorithms for classification, which include C4.5, kNN, Random Forest, LogitBoost, SVM, and Naive Bayes. The detailed evaluation of the results through 10-fold cross-validation reveals that SVM outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy of 98.43\%, F-measure of 98.42\%, sensitivity of 98.33\%, specificity of 98.56\% and AUC of 0.983. Thus, a PCA-based SVM approach appears to be an effective choice for accurate identification of ADHD patients among other clinical controls using real-time analysis of activity data.},

	abstract = {Background Effective and accurate diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is currently of significant interest. ADHD has been associated with multiple cortical features from structural MRI data. However, most existing learning algorithms for ADHD identification contain obvious defects, such as time-consuming training, parameters selection, etc. The aims of this study were as follows: (1) Propose an ADHD classification model using the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm for automatic, efficient and objective clinical ADHD diagnosis. (2) Assess the computational efficiency and the effect of sample size on both ELM and support vector machine (SVM) methods and analyze which brain segments are involved in ADHD. Methods High-resolution three-dimensional MR images were acquired from 55 ADHD subjects and 55 healthy controls. Multiple brain measures (cortical thickness, etc.) were calculated using a fully automated procedure in the FreeSurfer software package. In total, 340 cortical features were automatically extracted from 68 brain segments with 5 basic cortical features. F-score and SFS methods were adopted to select the optimal features for ADHD classification. Both ELM and SVM were evaluated for classification accuracy using leave-one-out cross-validation. Results We achieved ADHD prediction accuracies of 90.18\% for ELM using eleven combined features, 84.73\% for SVM-Linear and 86.55\% for SVM-RBF. Our results show that ELM has better computational efficiency and is more robust as sample size changes than is SVM for ADHD classification. The most pronounced differences between ADHD and healthy subjects were observed in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe and insular. Conclusion Our ELM-based algorithm for ADHD diagnosis performs considerably better than the traditional SVM algorithm. This result suggests that ELM may be used for the clinical diagnosis of ADHD and the investigation of different brain diseases.},

	abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of childhood’s most frequent neurobehavioral disorders. The purpose of this study is to: (i) extract the most prominent risk factors for children with ADHD; and (ii) propose a machine learning (ML)-based approach to classify children as either having ADHD or healthy. We extracted the data of 45,779 children aged 3–17 years from the 2018–2019 National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH, 2018–2019). About 5218 (11.4\%) of children were ADHD, and the rest of the children were healthy. Since the class label is highly imbalanced, we adopted a combination of oversampling and undersampling approaches to make a balanced class label. We adopted logistic regression (LR) to extract the significant factors for children with ADHD based on p-values ({\textless}0.05). Eight ML-based classifiers such as random forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), XGBoost, k-nearest neighborhood (KNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and 1-dimensional convolution neural network (1D CNN) were adopted for the prediction of children with ADHD. The average age of the children with ADHD was 12.4 ± 3.4 years. Our findings showed that RF-based classifier provided the highest classification accuracy of 85.5\%, sensitivity of 84.4\%, specificity of 86.4\%, and an AUC of 0.94. This study illustrated that LR with RF-based system could provide excellent accuracy for classifying and predicting children with ADHD. This system will be helpful for early detection and diagnosis of ADHD.},

This may cause significant delays in appropriate treatment initiation. An automated analysis relying on subjective and objective measures might not only simplify the diagnostic process and reduce the time to diagnosis, but also improve reproducibility. While recent machine learning studies have succeeded at distinguishing ADHD from healthy controls, the clinical process requires differentiating among other or multiple psychiatric conditions. We trained a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier to detect participants with ADHD in a population showing a broad spectrum of psychiatric conditions using anonymized data from clinical records (N = 299 participants). We differentiated children and adolescents with ADHD from those not having the condition with an accuracy of 66.1\%. SVM using single features showed slight differences between features and overlapping standard deviations of the achieved accuracies. An automated feature selection achieved the best performance using a combination 19 features. Real-world clinical data from medical records can be used to automatically identify individuals with ADHD among help-seeking individuals using machine learning. The relevant diagnostic information can be reduced using an automated feature selection without loss of performance. A broad combination of symptoms across different domains, rather than specific domains, seems to indicate an ADHD diagnosis.},

There is an increasing need to find objective measures and markers of the disorder in order to assess the efficacy of the therapies and to improve follow-up strategies. Actigraphy is an objective method for recording motor activity and sleep parameters that has been used in many studies in ADHD. Our meta-analysis aimed to assess the current evidence on the role of actigraphy in both the detection of changes in motor activity and in sleep patterns in ADHD. A systematic review was carried out to find studies comparing children with unmedicated ADHD versus controls, using actigraphic measures as an outcome. The primary outcome measures were “sleep duration” and daytime “activity mean”. As secondary outcome measures we analyzed “sleep onset latency”, “sleep efficiency” and “wake after sleep onset”. Twenty-four studies comprising 2179 children were included in this review. We show evidence that ADHD compared to typically developing children present a higher mean activity during structured sessions, a similar sleep duration, and a moderately altered sleep pattern. This study highlights the role of actigraphy as an objective tool for the ambulatory monitoring of sleep and activity in ADHD.},

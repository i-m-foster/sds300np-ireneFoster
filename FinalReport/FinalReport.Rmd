# Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that shares symptoms with many other conditions, and it is often misdiagnosed. It is estimated that 8.4% of children and 2.5% of adults have ADHD, and presentation and assessment are different in the two groups (@noauthor_what_nodate). There are three main types of ADHD: inattentive presentation, hyperactive/impulsive presentation, and combined presentation (@noauthor_what_nodate). The inattentive type is characterized by difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized (@noauthor_attention-deficithyperactivity_nodate). Hyperactivity is excessive movement and may present as restlessness or talking too much in adults (@noauthor_attention-deficithyperactivity_nodate). Impulsivity is when a person acts without thinking and may manifest as desire for immediate rewards or the inability to delay gratification (@noauthor_attention-deficithyperactivity_nodate). The combined type is when both symptoms of the inattentive type and the hyperactive/impulsive type are present (@noauthor_attention-deficithyperactivity_nodate). ADHD can impact individuals in many areas of their life such as academic/professional, interpersonal relationships, and daily functioning (@noauthor_what_nodate). In adults it can have far reaching detrimental effects and lead to poor self-worth, sensitivity towards criticism, and increased self-criticism (@noauthor_what_nodate). However, sometimes ADHD is not identified until a person is an adult if the symptoms were not recognized, they had mild ADHD, or they managed sufficiently well until demands of college/work (@noauthor_attention-deficithyperactivity_nodate2). Due to the harmful consequences ADHD can lead to, it is important that it is diagnosed and treated.

There are many challenges to diagnosing ADHD, particularly in adults. Adult ADHD symptoms are sometimes harder to discern than ADHD symptoms in children (@noauthor_adult_nodate). Combining this with the fact that adult ADHD symptoms are similar to those in other conditions can make diagnosis difficult (@noauthor_adult_nodate). Stress, illness, and other mental conditions such as anxiety or mood disorders can all have symptoms that are similar to ADHD (@noauthor_adult_nodate, @noauthor_attention-deficithyperactivity_nodate2. For example, emotional dysregulation present in ADHD can be diagnosed with a mood disorder or ADHD symptoms can be covered up by substance abuse (@pmid28830387). Physicians are also usually more familiar with mood and anxiety disorders, leading to misdiagnosis and delays in ADHD treatment (@pmid28830387). Additionally, other mental health conditions such as anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders are common in adults with ADHD (@noauthor_attention-deficithyperactivity_nodate2). Studies have shown that 18.6% to 53.3% of people with ADHD have depression and almost 50% of people with ADHD have an anxiety disorder (@pmid28830387). Some researchers suggest that in some cases stress, depression, and anxiety may be manifesting due to undiagnosed or untreated ADHD (@pmid28830387). These factors make ADHD difficult to recognize and treat, leading to an under-diagnosis and under-treatment of adult ADHD (@pmid28830387). Due to the extensive effects ADHD can have, it is important that it is properly diagnosed and treated. 

There is no specific procedure to diagnose ADHD and psychiatrists, neurologists, primary care doctors, clinical psychologists, or clinical social workers can all diagnose adults with ADHD (@contributors_diagnosing_nodate). Steps to getting a diagnosis may include a physician using behavioral questionnaires to ask about the impacts ADHD has, possible symptoms present in childhood, talking to a parent or partner, and psychological tests (@contributors_diagnosing_nodate).  They may also test for learning disabilities, other mental health conditions, or physical illnesses to rule these options out (@contributors_diagnosing_nodate). 


# Methods

## Dataset

[Contrast this to what would have been your ideal dataset. How did you arrive at choosing this dataset. Provide details on the dataset, size, gender split and count, age, how it was collected, ethical concerns, etc. Also provide details on data collection and access. Usually 100-200 words.]

## Data Cleaning

In the Hyperaktiv data set the time series data for each subject is stored in a separate CSV file. To analyze the data, I combined all of the activity CSVs into one file, keeping track of which subject each data point came from. **TODO: add more detail if needed** There were 108 subjects, yet only some had activity data. I only used subjects with activity data, which reduced the data set to 83. 

**TODO: comment on if I make all activity csvs same length, cleaning time series (seasonality, get rid of noise, etc.)**

**TODO: Add about heart rate if you get there**
